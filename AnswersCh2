Answer: True & False written with capital T & F and the rest lowercase.
	2.	What are the three Boolean operators?
 Answer: and, or and not
	3.	Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
Answer: 
True and True = True
True and False = False
False and True = False
False and False = False
True or True = True
True or False = True
False or True = True
False or False = False
not True = False
not False = True
	4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) 
Answer = False
not (5 > 4) 
Answer =  False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) 
Answer = True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) 
Answer = False
(True and True) and (True == False) 
Answer = False
(not False) or (not True) 
Answer = True
	4.	What are the six comparison operators?
 Answer: ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=

	5.	What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
Answer: == is the equal operator it asks if two values are the same. = is the assignment operator it assigns the value on the right int the variable on the left.
	6.	Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
Answer: in an expression in a flow control statement that is evaluated to a Boolean value
	8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')
Answer: if, if, else
	9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings!if anything else is stored in spam. Answer:
spam = 3
if spam == 1:
   print ('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
   print ('Howdy')
else:
   print ('Greetings!') 
	10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop? 
Answer: ctrl c
	11. What is the difference between break and continue?
Answer: break will stop outside the loop, continue will move to the start of the loop
	12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
Answer: they all do the same thing.
for i in range(10):
    print(i) #prints 0-9 
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i) #specifies start at 0, prints 0-9
for i in range(0, 10, 1):
    print(i) #specifies start at 0 increment by 1

	13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Answer:
for i in range(11):
    print(i)
i = i
while i ,= 10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
	14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importingspam?
Answer: spam.bacon()

Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
Answer: 
n = -818.8
print (abs(n)) #will print 818.8 you do not need to import math for this function

import math
print (abs(n)) #same result even after import math
print(math.floor(n)) #will print -819
print(math.ceil(n)) #will print -818
